## Why range requests matter?

1. Interrupted & Pause/Resume data transfers functionality.
2. Multi-part or Single-part data transfer between client and server systems.
3. Throughtput limitations from cloud service providers on the amount of transfered data allowed. 

## HTTP Range Requests Overview

The HTTP protocol implements headers and status codes that enable delivering large file objects over the internet in smaller pieces:

- **Content-Type**: `bytes`
- **Status Codes**: 206 Partial Content, 416 Range Not Satisfiable
- **Headers**: Range, Content-Range, Accept-Ranges, If-Range
- **Conditional Headers**: If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since

## Range Response Processing in FileResultHelper

ASP.NET Core has evolved over years to become a mature platform for building web applications. File sharing and serving binaries from the backend are among the features implemented by the platform. Following HTTP protocol standards, ASP.NET Core supports HTTP Range Requests for serving large binaries in relatively small chunks.

As we previously explored the result type hierarhy for serving file data, both legacy MVC Action Result and modern Results APIs share the internal file processing implementation in the static `FileResultHelper` class.

### SetHeadersAndLog

The primary orchestration method that manages headers and response content according to RFC specifications. Returns a tuple:

```csharp
(RangeItemHeaderValue? range, long rangeLength, bool serveBody)
```

**Note**: An empty `range` value means the binary is processed as a single entity without chunking.

### Freshness Validation

- **GetPreconditionState + GetMaxPreconditionState**: Validates data freshness using If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, and If-Unmodified-Since headers

### Header Configuration

- **SetLastModifiedAndEtagHeaders**: Sets LastModified and ETag headers
- **SetContentDispositionHeader**: Configures file download behavior and client delivery rules
- **Preliminary Content-Length**: Set to full file length; overwritten for range requests

### Range Processing Pipeline

Activated when `enableRangeProcessing` is enabled:

1. **Http Method & IfRangeValid**: Validates request method (HEAD/GET) and If-Range header against LastModified and EntityTag
2. **SetAcceptRangeHeader**: Sets `Accept-Ranges: bytes` 
3. **Condition Check**: If preconditions pass and IfRange is valid, range processing proceeds
4. **SetRangeHeaders + SetContentLength**: Main range handler, sets appropriate headers and response status (206 or 416) per RFC specifications

### Debugging

Enable Debug log level in the application logger to expose runtime events during range processing.
