## Conclusion

This design offers several significant benefits:

- **Ease of Extensibility:** Supporting new audience types is straightforward. Developers can add a new derived class and update the OpenAPI schema without requiring significant refactoring.
- **Cleaner Domain Model:** The use of polymorphism ensures that the domain model remains clean, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Focus on Business Flow:** Developers can dedicate their efforts to implementing the business logic rather than spending time on data transfer object (DTO) mapping.
- **Support for Batch Operations:** The polymorphic approach enables handling multiple audience types in a single request, simplifying batch operations and improving API usability.

However, this approach is not without its drawbacks:

- **Increased Complexity in Schema Management:** The OpenAPI schema becomes more complex due to the use of the `discriminator` property and the need for precise mappings.
- **Runtime Deserialization Errors:** If the discriminator mapping is not implemented correctly or if there are mismatches in case sensitivity, deserialization errors can occur at runtime.

By weighing these benefits and drawbacks, you can determine whether the polymorphic approach aligns with your project's requirements and priorities. While it simplifies handling polymorphic data and enhances code maintainability, careful attention must be given to schema accuracy and runtime behavior.
