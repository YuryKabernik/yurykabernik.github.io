![Agile Methodology](/assets/img/title/title-agile-methodology.png)

Over time, the Waterfall model became the primary methodology for the majority of software projects. Focus on steps that secure production flow but do not add actual value to the final product brought more complexity than benefits to developers' lives. Huge volumes of documentation helped to keep the process of software development under control, but eventually slowed it down and made any changes in initial requirements everyone's problem.

Agile emerged in the early 2000s as a response to the limitations of traditional methodologies like Waterfall. The new methodology of Agile Software Development was built around four core values:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

In comparison with previous methodologies, we are not trying to optimize production flow but allow industry experts to adapt quickly and decide what is necessary to deliver working software.

## Core Principles

Agile expands some of the best practices from both previous methodologies by adapting them to even more rapidly changing customer needs. This results in twelve guiding principles.

1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**
2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.**
3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.**

The major idea is to replace a monolithic solution with a series of short iterative cycles. Smaller release patches of valuable software help us to receive customer feedback faster and on a constant basis. With these principles we focus on what is important to the customer right now. We plan our sprint according to these values and once priorities change we adjust to them in the next sprint. There is no room for a long-running development of a complex project—make it simple, do it fast, and release frequently.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**
5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**
6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.**
7. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**
8. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

It is suggested to bring experts closer to each other, bring different departments to work beyond the scope of neighboring phases, and grow an environment of mutual assistance. The knowledge about the current system is constantly shared and problems are solved right at the moment when they emerge. These principles are one of the reasons why nowadays we work in cross-functional teams alongside Stakeholders, Software Architects, Software Developers, Quality Assurance Engineers, Product Owners, and Release Managers.

9. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**
10. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**
11. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**
12. **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.**

Without a doubt, all the efforts from the project team are aimed at delivering the best-class solution right into the hands of the end customer. The progress is measured by stable software operations and customer's satisfaction with constant release of valuable features. Keeping the software in the best shape means there is always room for new features, performance improvements, architectural modernization, and capacity for solving technical debt.

## Key Practices

Agile encompasses various frameworks including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), each with specific practices. Common Agile practices include iterative development through short cycles ("sprints"), daily stand-up meetings, and continuous integration and delivery.

## Strengths and Benefits

Agile's iterative approach offers several key advantages:

- **Flexible Process**: Flexibility gives the development team the ability to respond to customer demands and incorporate new ideas, which increases the value of the solution. Also, all stages of the development process may be executed in parallel, working on the current sprint and preparing the content for the next one at the same time.

- **Value Focused**: Continuously focusing on the user experience allows us to prioritize the most valuable features and eliminate features you discover are not important, which helps control costs. Project resources might be saved by not investing in functionality that does not meet customer needs.

- **Faster Releases**: Enables your team to develop and release iterative solutions to the market rapidly. No need to wait for a complete solution when you can beat your competitors by being the first who delivered the most desirable feature faster.

- **Identify Issues Early**: Testing early and often enables your team to identify issues and resolve those issues before switching your context to the next iteration. The earlier the team will identify issues, the less rework is required in future.

- **Team Involvement**: Team, involved in business needs and collaborating with business people, may recommend improvements that would bring even greater value unseen from the customer's perspective.

## Challenges and Considerations

While Agile offers many benefits, it also presents several challenges that teams should be aware of:

- **Lack of Predictability**: Inability to predict the overall development costs may result in underbudgeting teams and departments. Also, unexpectedly changing requirements might bring confusion and miscommunication when not properly communicated within teams.

- **Lack of Documentation**: Insufficient documentation complicates maintenance, onboarding, and cross-team knowledge sharing. Documentation should not fade into oblivion; Agile does not exclude documentation—teams must plan and refresh it so artifacts remain accurate and up to date.

- **Waterfall Sprints**: Software development life cycle of each sprint may vary from project to project, but mostly follows the same Waterfall sequential stages: Requirements, Design, Develop, Test, and Deploy. Stages are highly coupled, meaning preceding stages must be completed before the next stage can be started. Insufficient requirements at the beginning of the sprint might result in severe impediments in succeeding sprint goals and delivery schedules.

- **Sprint Race**: Unrealistic sprint goals, inaccurate estimations, or misused practices eventually turn a simple and adaptable methodology into an endless race for deadlines. When the team needs to hurry to fit in committed timelines, it seriously affects their performance, accuracy, and morale, committing people to overtimes and burnouts.

## Conclusion

Agile methodology represents a fundamental shift in software development, prioritizing adaptability, customer collaboration, and iterative delivery over rigid planning and comprehensive documentation. While it requires cultural change and disciplined practice to implement successfully, Agile's focus on delivering value quickly and responding to change makes it particularly well-suited for dynamic environments where requirements evolve. Understanding both its strengths in flexibility and its challenges in predictability is essential for teams considering an Agile adoption.
